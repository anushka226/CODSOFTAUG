These are the tasks provided by CodSoft in the August batch. This is with the purpose of learning and growing. 
The first task is to create a TO-DO-LIST which can help you get, and stay, on top of important projects and piles of tasks or decisions.
This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.
The second task is to make a calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice, perform the calculation, and display the result.
