# CODSOFTAUG
These are the tasks provided by CodSoft in the August batch. This is with the purpose of learning and growing. 
The first task #task1 is to create a TO-DO-LIST which can help you get, and stay, on top of important projects and piles of tasks or decisions.
This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.

The second task #task3 is to make a calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice, perform the calculation, and display the result.
#task3 is which was to create a Password Generator, a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

It includes:

--- User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.

--- Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.

--- Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.



During this project, I get to learn more about the module String and Random which includes very simplified functions that help in increasing the time complexity of the code and the code reusability as a programmer.
